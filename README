File upload example
===================

This example shows how to set up simple AJAX file upload. The changes are all
client-side; on the server, all Lift code is written as if file upload were
fully AJAX-supported (see src/main/webapp/fileUpload.html and
src/main/scala/code/snippet/FileUpload.scala). jQuery is used to retarget the
form to submit to an iframe, whose results are then eval'ed (see
src/main/webapp/static/js/fileUpload.js).

Due to this last part, much like old-style AJAX, this solution is same-origin
only (it does not support Cross-Origin specs).

IE
==

Internet Explorer tries to save files served as text/javascript to an iframe as
if they were a file download. We use a Lift response transformer to force the
content type to text/plain in these cases (see Boot.scala).

Limitations
===========

You'll have to do error handling client-side. In particular, a failed request
won't necessarily give you status code info and such. This is `fake AJAX', late
'90s-style.
